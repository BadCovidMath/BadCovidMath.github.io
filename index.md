Welcome to the Bad Covid Math blog. This was started after we realized that many countries, Australia in particular, seemed to be guided more by political calculations than by pandemic science. In particular, we would like to see Australia recognise that its quarantine policies with regards to low-risk regions of origin like China are quite backwards.

## How COVID Case numbers differ by region

| Region | 7-Day Average Local Cases (12 Sept 2021) | Population | People per Local Case | Source | Comment |
|-----------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|------------|------------|
| United Kingdom | 36731 | 66.6Million | 1:1800 | coronavirus.jhu.edu | Probable undercount |
| United States | 144990 | 328Million | 1:2300 | coronavirus.jhu.edu | Probable undercount |
| New South Wales | 1400 | 8.2Million | 1:6000 | covidlive.com.au | Stable |
| Germany | 9482 | 83Million | 1:8800 | coronavirus.jhu.edu | |
| Victoria | 312 | 6.7Million | 1:21000 | covidlive.com.au | Rising |
| New Zealand | 11 | 4.8Million | 1:230000 | coronavirus.jhu.edu | Stable |

## Local Transmissions in China

According to [coronavirus.jhu.edu](coronavirus.jhu.edu) China has been reporting average case numbers of around 50 per day. However, a closer look at the details in China's own reporting at the [National Health Commision of the Peoples Republic of China](http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) these case numbers are dominated by overseas arrivals. A search through the historical data shows that China has frequently been reporting zero local transmissions. However, like Australia they have had a few local outbreaks (especially in the Delta era). A basic estimate for the last few months suggests an average local transmission rate **easily below 10 cases per day**. Furthermore, these cases have usually been tracked and contained.

A case rate below 1:143Million people!

## Are China's extremely local case numbers accurate?

It's impossible to truly verify any regions COVID case numbers entirely independently. However, in the case of Zero-COVID regions it is possible to extrapolate with extremely high certainty if there is local transmission. As someone currently living in China here are a few reasons to believe that China is holding community transmission at very close to zero.

1. Hong Kong has experimented with opening its border to Mainland China and [admitted 200 000 Chinese](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3147811/coronavirus-quarantine-free-return2hk-scheme-hong?module=perpetual_scroll&pgtype=article&campaign=3147811) with testing and without quarantine. It recorded zero positive tests among the incoming population and now has in incoming open border with the Mainland.
2. It has been demonstrated that it is not possible to allow community transmission in a population without hard lockdowns. While China adopts several measures like mask-wearing it is not locked down except in regions with recent outbreaks and these have been 'unlocked' quickly showing they did not grow to a very significant size.
3. Anyone living in China can see that China's mass transit systems have remained open in 2021. A move not possible in the presence of local transmission.
4. China has shown extreme resolve in maintaining a zero-COVID policy with mass testing, being willing to test entire cities with 10â€™s of millions of people.
5. China maintains **extreme transparency** regarding possible local transmissions as members of the public are warned to avoid any area with the most miniscule risk. For example, after a airport worker in Shanghai fell ill every working person in the city was required to report to their managers to confirm they had not been in the vicinity of this case. In the end, only the airport workers family members fell ill.
6. The use of the so-called health-code system applies an extreme form of "digital contagion". People in China don't worry about getting COVID-19, but they go out of their way to avoid lossing a 'green' health code. This means being informed of any area where a local transmission has ever occured in recent weeks.

## What is the Australian Break-Out Rate for Hotel Quarantine?

Australian politicians have enjoyed claiming their system is 99.99% effective and preventing transmission. However, this is because these politicians are giving themselves credit for preventing COVID-19 from spreading from **negative** cases. Yes! They are counting cases without COVID-19 as 'prevention'. Yes, Australian has admitted 100's of thousands of people but only a few thousand have had COVID. The [COVIDLIVE](covidlive.com.au) website keeps comprehensive statistics an break out cases in Australia. This shows:

| Time Period | Break-out Rate |
|---------|------------|
| Pre-Delta | 1:200 |
| Post-Delta | 1:75 |

## What is the Australian "Break-In" Rate to Hotel Quarantine?

Australia does not keep statistics on this though there have been known cases of guest-to-guest transmission in Hotel Quarantine. Indeed, while Australia has been succeeding at maintaining a near ZERO-COVID environment it would be an extremely unlikely event. However, given the design of quarantine proceedures it can be assumed that the "Break-In" rate is probably much higher than the Break-Out rate of 1:75. However, as a conservative estimate the 1:75 can suffice.

This does not mean that there is 1 break-in event for every 75 people in quarantine. Rather this 1:75 ratio must be combined with the base rate of COVID-19 in the community. That is, it should be multiplied by the 1:6000 (1 case per 6000 NSW residents) to find a plausible break-in rate. This would be break-in per 450000 people quarantined. Extremely low! But not as low as the base rate for local transmission in Mainland China. Indeed it is 317 times worse! This is where the 'headline' figure of 300 times more likely to have COVID after quarantine comes from.

## FAQ

- **Aren't Quarantine Hotel Australian Workers Vaccinated and Tested Regularly - How can they spread COVID to those inside?**. The good thing about simply 'stealing' the 1:75 Break-Out rate is that it applies both ways. For a case to break-out it must:
  1. Find a viral host
  2. Infect this host enough for onward transmission
  3. and this transmission must happen before testing is positive and they themselves are quarantined

  These are the same sets of conditions that need to be true for a case to break-in to quarantine. i.e. Anything like vaccination and testing that prevents break-in is **already** counted in the break-out estimate.

- **Are hotel quarantine workers likely to have COVID?** This is hard to tell. On one hand they are vaccinated and tested regularly but they are also frontline essential workers. They were faccinated first precisely because of their likelihood of being exposed to COVID-19. Socially and economically, they are likely mixing with other essential workers and their children are likely to attend daycare, school, etc. It's likely that this as about a break-even scenario for COVID risk.
