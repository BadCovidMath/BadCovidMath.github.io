Welcome to the Bad Covid Math blog. This was started after we realized that many countries, Australia in particular, seemed to be guided more by political calculations than by pandemic science. In particular, we would like to see Australia recognise that its quarantine policies with regards to low-risk regions of origin like China are quite backwards.

Australia wants to live with COVID but in regards to returning Australians from China (and Chinese students and tourists) it has not even learnt to live without COVID. As an expat living in China it is unbelievable that NSW would want me to quarantine for a total of 28 days! 14 Days in Sydney and another 14 days when arriving in the South Coast. It's obvious to those of us living in China that they have succeeded in achieving a ZERO-COVID strategy and intend to keep this for the forseeable future. Yet, Australia has failed to recognise this leaving Australian's trapped abroad and unable to enter due to the strict quota arrangements.
